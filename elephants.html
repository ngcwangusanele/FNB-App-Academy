                <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
    <p>Elephants are large mammals of the family 
        Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea.Two species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant 
        (Loxodonta Africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephanas maximus)are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa,
          South Asia, and Southern Asia. Male Africa elephants are the largest
        extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4m(13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).</p>
        <p>All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable of which is a long trunk or
        proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breating, lifting water and grasping objects. 
        Their imcisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and
         digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like 
         legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while
          Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
            <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including sannahs,forests,
                deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>

                <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                <P>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</P>
